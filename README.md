# Robot Arm Torque Analysis

This repo outlines the torque calculations required for the servo motors of a 3-axis robotic arm designed to lift a 1 kg object. It also explores the feasibility of lifting a 2 kg object.

### Robotic Arm Configuration

The arm consists of three primary joints, and the calculations are based on the moment the arm is fully extended horizontally, as this is when the maximum torque is required.

### Assumptions and Formula

*   **Load Mass:** 1 kg
*   **Gravitational Acceleration (g):** 9.8 m/s²
*   **Arm Link Weights:** The weight of the arm segments is considered negligible for this calculation.
*   **Torque Formula:** `Torque (N.m) = Force (N) × Radius (m)`
*   **Unit Conversion:** To convert Newton-meters (N.m) to kilogram-centimeters (kg.cm) for comparing with servo datasheets, we use the conversion factor: `1 N.m ≈ 10.2 kg.cm`

## Part 1: Torque Calculation for 1 kg Load

The force generated by the 1 kg load is `1 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 9.8 N`.

### Joint 1: Base/Shoulder Servo

This motor must support the entire load at the maximum reach of the arm.

*   **Total Radius:** 0.15m + 0.10m + 0.04m = 0.29m
*   **Torque (N.m):** 9.8 N × 0.29m = **2.84 N.m**
*   **Torque (kg.cm):** 2.84 N.m × 10.2 = **28.98 kg.cm**

### Joint 2: Elbow Servo

This motor supports the load from the elbow joint to the end-effector.

*   **Total Radius:** 0.10m + 0.04m = 0.14m
*   **Torque (N.m):** 9.8 N × 0.14m = **1.37 N.m**
*   **Torque (kg.cm):** 1.37 N.m × 10.2 = **13.99 kg.cm**

### Joint 3: Wrist Servo

This motor supports the load at the wrist.

*   **Total Radius:** 0.04m
*   **Torque (N.m):** 9.8 N × 0.04m = **0.392 N.m**
*   **Torque (kg.cm):** 0.392 N.m × 10.2 = **4.0 kg.cm**

### Motor Selection (1kg Load)

It is crucial to select motors with a stall torque higher than the calculated requirement to ensure reliability and prevent burnout.

| Joint            | Required Torque | Selected Motor | Rated Torque |
| ---------------- | :-------------: | :------------: | :----------: |
| **1 (Shoulder)** |  ~29.0 kg.cm    |    **DS3235**  |  33 kg.cm    |
| **2 (Elbow)**    |  ~14.0 kg.cm    |    **DS3218**  |  18 kg.cm    |
| **3 (Wrist)**    |  ~4.0 kg.cm     |     **R10**    |  8 kg.cm     |

## Part 2: Analysis for Lifting a 2 kg Load

### Can we lift 2 kg with the same motors using a gearbox?

Yes, Adding a gearbox allows you to trade speed for torque.

If the load is doubled to 2 kg, the required torque for each joint also doubles:
*   **Joint 1 (Shoulder) New Torque:** 28.98 × 2 = **57.96 kg.cm**
*   **Joint 2 (Elbow) New Torque:** 13.99 × 2 = **27.98 kg.cm**
*   **Joint 3 (Wrist) New Torque:** 4 x 2 = **8 kg.cm**

The selected motors (DS3235 and DS3218) can no longer handle this load directly. By adding a **2:1 gear ratio**, you would double the output torque of the motor, making the lift possible. However, this comes at the cost of cutting the operational speed in half.

### Downsides of Gearing and Alternative Solutions

#### Disadvantages of Using a Gearbox

1.  **Reduced Speed:** The arm's movement becomes significantly slower.
2.  **Increased Mechanical Complexity:** Adding gears increases weight, size, and potential points of failure.
3.  **Increased Noise:** Geared systems are typically louder than direct-drive motors.

#### Alternative Solutions

1.  **Use Stronger Motors:** The most straightforward solution is to select motors rated for the higher (2 kg) load requirement from the start.
2.  **Use Mechanical Assists:** Integrating springs or counterweights into the design can help balance the load, reducing the required torque.
3.  **Optimize Arm Design:** Shortening the link lengths would proportionally reduce the torque required from the motors.
